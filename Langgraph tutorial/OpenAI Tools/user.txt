Problem:
--------
    A. Square String?
    time limit per test1 second
    memory limit per test256 megabytes
    A string is called square if it is some string written twice in a row. For example, the strings "aa", "abcabc", "abab" and "baabaa" are square. But the strings "aaa", "abaaab" and "abcdabc" are not square.

    For a given string s
    determine if it is square.

    Input
    The first line of input data contains an integer t
    (1≤t≤100
    ) —the number of test cases.

    This is followed by t
    lines, each containing a description of one test case. The given strings consist only of lowercase Latin letters and have lengths between 1
    and 100
    inclusive.

    Output
    For each test case, output on a separate line:

    YES if the string in the corresponding test case is square,
    NO otherwise.
    You can output YES and NO in any case (for example, strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as a positive response).

    Example:
    Input:
    10
    a
    aa
    aaa
    aaaa
    abab
    abcabc
    abacaba
    xxyy
    xyyx
    xyxy
    Output:
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    YES

User Solution:
--------------
    #include<string>
    #include<iostream>

    using namespace std;
    int main()

    {
        int t;
        cin>>t;
        while(t--){
        string s;
        cin>>s;
        int flg=0;
        if(s.length()%2!=0) cout<<"No"<<endl;
        else{
            int half=s.length()/2;
            for(int i=0,j=half; i<half; i++,j++){
                if(s[i] != s[j])
                { 
                flg=1; break;
                }
            }
            if(flg) cout<<"No"<<endl;
            else cout<<"Yes"<<endl;
        }
        }
    }
