    "\n",
    "Research literature review represents a significant time investment in R&D, with studies showing that researchers spend 30-50% of their time reading, analyzing, and synthesizing academic papers. This challenge is universal across the research community. While thorough literature review is crucial for advancing science and technology, the current process remains inefficient and time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key challenges include:\n",
    "- Extensive time commitment (30-50% of R&D hours) dedicated to reading and processing papers\n",
    "- Inefficient search processes across fragmented database ecosystems\n",
    "- Complex task of synthesizing and connecting findings across multiple papers\n",
    "- Resource-intensive maintenance of comprehensive literature reviews\n",
    "- Ongoing effort required to stay current with new publications"

It requires complex reasoning to\\\\nexamine the model\\'s errors, hypothesize what is missing or misleading in the\\\\ncurrent prompt, and communicate the task with clarity. While recent works\\\\nindicate that LLMs can be meta-prompted to perform automatic prompt\\\\nengineering, their potentials may not be fully untapped due to the lack of\\\\nsufficient guidance to elicit complex reasoning capabilities in LLMs in the\\\\nmeta-prompt. In this work, we investigate the problem of \\\\\"prompt engineering a\\\\nprompt engineer\\\\\" -- constructing a meta-prompt that more effectively guides\\\\nLLMs to perform automatic prompt engineering. We introduce and analyze key\\\\ncomponents, such as a step-by-step reasoning template and context\\\\nspecification, which lead to improved performance. In addition, inspired by\\\\ncommon optimization concepts such as batch size, step size and momentum, we\\\\nintroduce their verbalized counterparts to the meta-prompt and investigate\\\\ntheir effects. Our final method, named PE2, finds a prompt that outperforms\\\\n\\\\\"let\\'s think step by step\\\\\" by 6.3% on the MultiArith dataset and 3.1% on the\\\\nGSM8K dataset. To demonstrate its versatility, we apply PE2 to the Instruction\\\\nInduction benchmark, a suite of counterfactual tasks, and a lengthy, real-world\\\\nindustrial prompt. In these settings, PE2 achieves strong performance and\\\\noutperforms prior automatic prompt engineering baselines. Further, we show that\\\\nPE2 makes meaningful and targeted prompt edits, amends erroneous or incomplete\\\\nprompts, and presents non-trivial counterfactual reasoning abilities,\\\\n* Paper URLs: [\\'http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05661\\']\\\\n-----\\\\n* ID: 604035754,\\\\n* Title: Prompt Engineering: for Students of Medicine and Their Teachers,\\\\n* Published Date: 2023-01-01T00:00:00+00:00,\\\\n* Authors: Heston,\\\\u00a0Thomas,\\\\n* Abstract: \\\\\"Prompt Engineering for Students of Medicine and Their Teachers\\\\\" brings the principles of prompt engineering for large language models such as ChatGPT and Google Bard to medical education. This book contains a comprehensive guide to prompt engineering to help both teachers and students improve education in the medical field. Just as prompt engineering is critical in getting good information out of an AI, it is also critical to get students to think and understand more deeply. The principles of prompt engineering that we have learned from AI systems have the potential to simultaneously revolutionize learning in the healthcare field.The book analyzes from multiple angles the anatomy of a good prompt for both AI models and students. The different types of prompts are examined, showing how each style has unique characteristics and applications. The principles of prompt engineering, applied properly, are demonstrated to be effective in teaching across the diverse fields of anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, and clinical skills.Just like ChatGPT and similar large language AI models, students need clear and detailed prompting in order for them to fully understand a topic. Using identical principles, a prompt that gets good information from an AI will also cause a student to think more deeply and accurately. The process of prompt engineering facilitates this process.Because each chapter contains multiple examples and key takeaways, it is a practical guide for implementing prompt engineering in the learning process. It provides a hands-on approach to ensure readers can immediately apply the concepts they learn,\\\\n* Paper URLs: [\\'https://rex.libraries.wsu.edu/view/delivery/01ALLIANCE_WSU/12410907980001842/13410907970001842\\']\\\\n-----\\\\n* ID: 596212059,\\\\n* Title: Unleashing the potential of prompt engineering in Large Language Models:\\\\n  a comprehensive review,\\\\n* Published Date: 2023-10-27T01:00:00+01:00,\\\\n* Authors: Chen, Banghao and Zhang, Zhaofeng and Langren\\\\u00e9, Nicolas and Zhu, Shengxin,\\\\n* Abstract: This paper delves into the pivotal role of prompt engineering in unleashing\\\\nthe capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Prompt engineering is the\\\\nprocess of structuring input text for LLMs and is a technique integral to\\\\noptimizing the efficacy of LLMs. This survey elucidates foundational principles\\\\nof prompt engineering, such as role-prompting, one-shot, and few-shot\\\\nprompting, as well as more advanced methodologies such as the chain-of-thought\\\\nand tree-of-thoughts prompting. The paper sheds light on how external\\\\nassistance in the form of plugins can assist in this task, and reduce machine\\\\nhallucination by retrieving external knowledge. We subsequently delineate\\\\nprospective directions in prompt engineering research, emphasizing the need for\\\\na deeper understanding of structures and the role of agents in Artificial\\\\nIntelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) tools. We discuss how to assess the\\\\nefficacy of prompt methods from different perspectives and using different\\\\nmethods. Finally, we gather information about the application of prompt\\\\nengineering in such fields as education and programming, showing its\\\\ntransformative potential.

Such systems are capable of generating free-text output based on a provided input prompt. Given the outputs\\\\u2019 sensitivity to the prompt, many techniques for prompt engineering were proposed both anecdotally in social media and increasingly in literature. It is, however, unclear if and how such a system and such techniques can be employed in creative contexts such as for generating ideas. In our study, we investigate the effects of using six prompt engineering techniques. For each combination of techniques, we have GPT-3 generate ideas for an exemplary scenario. The ideas are rated according to novelty and value. We report on the effects of the (combinations of) prompt engineering techniques. With our study, we contribute to the emerging field of prompt engineering and shed light on supporting idea generation with GLMs, showing a pathway to embedded GLM capabilities,\\\\n* Paper URLs: [\\'https://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1172&context=hicss-57\\']\"', name='search-papers', id='7c98db07-b37b-4a82-89ae-d0d6f512bca8', tool_call_id='call_kU2ABN4dDFKkryThvvtcLhH7'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_dK8ND01Lg1KylCnXPDMVhxiZ', 'function': {'arguments': '{\"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05661\"}', 'name': 'download-paper'}, 'type': 'function'}, {'id': 'call_VkNArZgfbavPvkUziclMwRxt', 'function': {'arguments': '{\"url\": \"https://rex.libraries.wsu.edu/view/delivery/01ALLIANCE_WSU/12410907980001842/13410907970001842\"}', 'name': 'download-paper'}, 'type': 'function'}, {'id': 'call_jLkzniX8VwoBnbd7flTlEW6U', 'function': {'arguments': '{\"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14735\"}', 'name': 'download-paper'}, 'type': 'function'}, {'id': 'call_IIEZr1YLVY5bSgOAhYC3hRah', 'function': {'arguments': '{\"url\": \"https://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1172&context=hicss-57\"}', 'name': 'download-paper'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 151, 'prompt_tokens': 2353, 'total_tokens': 2504, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_f9f4fb6dbf', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-79154707-6fa5-418b-8bcc-0aa48e332aa9-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'download-paper', 'args': {'url': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05661'}, 'id': 'call_dK8ND01Lg1KylCnXPDMVhxiZ', 'type': 'tool_call'}, {'name': 'download-paper', 'args': {'url': 'https://rex.libraries.wsu.edu/view/delivery/01ALLIANCE_WSU/12410907980001842/13410907970001842'}, 'id': 'call_VkNArZgfbavPvkUziclMwRxt', 'type': 'tool_call'}, {'name': 'download-paper', 'args': {'url': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14735'}, 'id': 'call_jLkzniX8VwoBnbd7flTlEW6U', 'type': 'tool_call'}, {'name': 'download-paper', 'args': {'url': 'https://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1172&context=hicss-57'}, 'id': 'call_IIEZr1YLVY5bSgOAhYC3hRah', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2353, 'output_tokens': 151, 'total_tokens': 2504, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), ToolMessage(content='\"Error downloading paper: No /Root object! - Is this really a PDF?\"', name='download-paper', id='97043918-26ca-413e-8c08-60d7d24a7ebb', tool_call_id='call_dK8ND01Lg1KylCnXPDMVhxiZ'), ToolMessage(content='\"Prompt Engineering\\\\nFor Students of Medicine and Their Teachers\\\\nThomas F.

It requires complex reasoning to\\\\nexamine the model\\'s errors, hypothesize what is missing or misleading in the\\\\ncurrent prompt, and communicate the task with clarity. While recent works\\\\nindicate that LLMs can be meta-prompted to perform automatic prompt\\\\nengineering, their potentials may not be fully untapped due to the lack of\\\\nsufficient guidance to elicit complex reasoning capabilities in LLMs in the\\\\nmeta-prompt. In this work, we investigate the problem of \\\\\"prompt engineering a\\\\nprompt engineer\\\\\" -- constructing a meta-prompt that more effectively guides\\\\nLLMs to perform automatic prompt engineering. We introduce and analyze key\\\\ncomponents, such as a step-by-step reasoning template and context\\\\nspecification, which lead to improved performance. In addition, inspired by\\\\ncommon optimization concepts such as batch size, step size and momentum, we\\\\nintroduce their verbalized counterparts to the meta-prompt and investigate\\\\ntheir effects. Our final method, named PE2, finds a prompt that outperforms\\\\n\\\\\"let\\'s think step by step\\\\\" by 6.3% on the MultiArith dataset and 3.1% on the\\\\nGSM8K dataset. To demonstrate its versatility, we apply PE2 to the Instruction\\\\nInduction benchmark, a suite of counterfactual tasks, and a lengthy, real-world\\\\nindustrial prompt. In these settings, PE2 achieves strong performance and\\\\noutperforms prior automatic prompt engineering baselines. Further, we show that\\\\nPE2 makes meaningful and targeted prompt edits, amends erroneous or incomplete\\\\nprompts, and presents non-trivial counterfactual reasoning abilities,\\\\n* Paper URLs: [\\'http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05661\\']\\\\n-----\\\\n* ID: 604035754,\\\\n* Title: Prompt Engineering: for Students of Medicine and Their Teachers,\\\\n* Published Date: 2023-01-01T00:00:00+00:00,\\\\n* Authors: Heston,\\\\u00a0Thomas,\\\\n* Abstract: \\\\\"Prompt Engineering for Students of Medicine and Their Teachers\\\\\" brings the principles of prompt engineering for large language models such as ChatGPT and Google Bard to medical education. This book contains a comprehensive guide to prompt engineering to help both teachers and students improve education in the medical field. Just as prompt engineering is critical in getting good information out of an AI, it is also critical to get students to think and understand more deeply. The principles of prompt engineering that we have learned from AI systems have the potential to simultaneously revolutionize learning in the healthcare field.The book analyzes from multiple angles the anatomy of a good prompt for both AI models and students. The different types of prompts are examined, showing how each style has unique characteristics and applications. The principles of prompt engineering, applied properly, are demonstrated to be effective in teaching across the diverse fields of anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, and clinical skills.Just like ChatGPT and similar large language AI models, students need clear and detailed prompting in order for them to fully understand a topic. Using identical principles, a prompt that gets good information from an AI will also cause a student to think more deeply and accurately. The process of prompt engineering facilitates this process.Because each chapter contains multiple examples and key takeaways, it is a practical guide for implementing prompt engineering in the learning process. It provides a hands-on approach to ensure readers can immediately apply the concepts they learn,\\\\n* Paper URLs: [\\'https://rex.libraries.wsu.edu/view/delivery/01ALLIANCE_WSU/12410907980001842/13410907970001842\\']\\\\n-----\\\\n* ID: 596212059,\\\\n* Title: Unleashing the potential of prompt engineering in Large Language Models:\\\\n  a comprehensive review,\\\\n* Published Date: 2023-10-27T01:00:00+01:00,\\\\n* Authors: Chen, Banghao and Zhang, Zhaofeng and Langren\\\\u00e9, Nicolas and Zhu, Shengxin,\\\\n* Abstract: This paper delves into the pivotal role of prompt engineering in unleashing\\\\nthe capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).

The authors introduce key components like a step-by-step reasoning template and context specification, which improve performance. They also introduce verbalized counterparts to optimization concepts such as batch size and step size. The method, named PE2, outperforms previous approaches on datasets like MultiArith and GSM8K, demonstrating strong performance in various settings and showcasing meaningful prompt edits and counterfactual reasoning abilities [Ye et al., 2023].\\n\\n2. **Prompt Engineering: for Students of Medicine and Their Teachers**:\\n   This book applies the principles of prompt engineering to medical education, aiming to improve teaching and learning. It covers the anatomy of a good prompt, different types of prompts, and strategies for effective prompt design. The book emphasizes the iterative nature of prompt engineering and its role in enhancing engagement, understanding, retention, and critical thinking in medical education. It provides practical examples and key takeaways for implementing prompt engineering in educational settings [Heston, 2023].\\n\\n3. **Unleashing the Potential of Prompt Engineering in Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Review**:\\n   This paper reviews the role of prompt engineering in optimizing the capabilities of LLMs. It discusses foundational principles like role-prompting and few-shot prompting, as well as advanced methodologies such as chain-of-thought prompting. The paper highlights the potential of plugins to assist in prompt engineering and reduce machine hallucination. It also explores the application of prompt engineering in fields like education and programming, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of structures and the role of agents in AI-generated content [Chen et al., 2023].\\n\\n4. **The More Is Not the Merrier: Effects of Prompt Engineering on the Quality of Ideas Generated By GPT-3**:\\n   This study investigates the effects of six prompt engineering techniques on the quality of ideas generated by GPT-3. The authors find that while some techniques improve idea novelty and value, combining multiple techniques does not necessarily enhance quality. The study highlights the importance of carefully selecting prompt techniques based on the task\\'s context and goals. It contributes to the understanding of prompt engineering in creative tasks and suggests that over-engineering prompts may not always be beneficial [Memmert et al., 2024].\\n\\nThese papers collectively explore various aspects of prompt engineering, from educational applications to optimizing LLM performance and understanding the effects of different techniques on idea generation.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 530, 'prompt_tokens': 100933, 'total_tokens': 101463, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_f9f4fb6dbf', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-41529988-e91c-49a9-a126-878996fe0a26-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 100933, 'output_tokens': 530, 'total_tokens': 101463, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]}\n"
